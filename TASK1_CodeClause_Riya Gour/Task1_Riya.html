    <p class = "info">A total of 522 responses from all over India were received. 
        The respondents have adequate awareness for COVID‐19 outbreak and its preventive measures, out of total, 98% (513) answered that 
        the virus spreads from one person to another, 95% (494) answered that the disease is caused by a virus. The novel corona virus 
        disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents an important and urgent threat to global health and its effect is expected to get even worse in 
        the middle- and low-income countries where the health system is weak and fragile. Timely access to accurate information and public 
        awareness on prevention methods is one of the feasible interventions in these countries. Identifying level of public awareness on 
        disease prevention is important to mitigate the pandemic. The aim of this study was to explore the level of awareness and prevention
         methods of COVID-19 among residents in Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia. As of end January 2021, the coronavirus disease 2019 
         (COVID-19) has infected approximately 100 million people, leading to more than 2 million deaths globally1. This global pandemic has 
         brought upon unprecedented challenges worldwide. Given the rapid spread of COVID-19, a society’s awareness and knowledge of 
         COVID-19, key preventative measures (e.g., wearing masks) and acceptance of new models of care (e.g., video-consultations)2 is 
         important. Many communication channels have been concurrently swamped by a deluge of misinformation (hence, dubbed an “infodemic”)3, 
         further highlighting the need for policy makers and healthcare providers to provide reliable information that is easily understood 
         and accessible4,5. Adequate health literacy amongst the general population is also critical to complement government-implemented 
         measures. Having a high level of awareness about recommended preventive health behaviour (e.g., mask wearing, hand hygiene) are 
         essential safeguards against the community spread of COVID-19. All of these can significantly improve disease prevention, timely 
         diagnosis and management.</p>
